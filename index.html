            In many ways, they'll miss the good old days
            Someday
            Someday
            Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
            Sometimes
            Sometimes
            When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
            Always
            Always
            Promises, they break before they're made
            Sometimes
            Sometimes
            Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
            I will do my best
            You say you want to stand by my side
            Darling, your head's not right
            Ah, see, alone we stand, together we fall apart
            Yeah, I think I'll be alright
            I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
            Tables, they turn sometimes
            Oh, someday
            No, I ain't wasting no more time
            And now my fears they come to me in threes
            So I
            Sometimes
            Say, fate, my friend, you say the strangest things
            I find, sometimes
            Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
            Shit, I will try my best
            You say you want to stand by my side
            Darling, your head's not right
            Ah, see, alone we stand, together we fall apart
            Yeah, I think I'll be alright
            I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
            Tables, they turn sometimes
            Oh, someday
            I ain't wasting no more time
